\section*{Statement}

Given a binary tree which has T nodes, you need to find the diameter of that binary tree. The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.

\section*{Input}

First line contains two integers, $T$ and $X$, the number of nodes in the tree and value of the root node. The following $2 \times (T - 1)$ lines contain details of the nodes.

Each node is described by two lines. The first line contains a string and the second contains an integer, which denote the path to the node from root and the value of the node respectively.

The string consists of the characters $L$ and $R$ only. $L$ denotes left child and $R$ denotes right child.

\section*{Output}

Print the diameter of the binary tree.

\section*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $1 \le T \le 20$
    \item $1 \le valueofnodes \le 20$
\end{itemize}

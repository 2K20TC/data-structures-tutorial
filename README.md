# data-structures-tutorial

This tutorial course aims to provide hands-on practice and familiarization with various basic data structures.

## Requirements

- Basic Git/GitHub knowledge
- GNU/Linux or macOS system (recommended)

## Procedure

All the problems have been categorised based on the specific topic. The problem statement (in PDF form) is kept within each problem directory. The test cases (to be verified using the script described below) are kept in the `tests` subdirectory for each problem.

The solution code should be placed in a *single source file* within the problem directory, named `solution.c`. Before testing your solutions, ensure that that the directory permissions have not been tampered with, and that your compiler toolchain has been properly installed. If you face any difficulties in the process, contact a TC representative.

## Evaluation

The problems presented in this tutorial is not intended to be of competitive nature. As such, the TC will not be evaluating your submissions individually. To evaluate your answers, a [test-case verification script](https://github.com/2K20TC/data-structures-tutorial) has been provided to you, with the usage instructions provided in the repository README. You can get the latest version from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2K20TC/testcase-verifier/master/checker.sh).

However, we mandate that all participants submit a pull request with all problems completed before the stipulated deadline. The pull requests will not be merged; instead, we treat them as **proof of your submission**.
